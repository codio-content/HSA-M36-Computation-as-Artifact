Create a paper version of your app.  You should include all the screens and buttons to navigate between the screens.

The focus here is a field of computing known as human-computer-interaction (HCI).  We want to make sure that your app is intuitive to use and does not leave users stuck on a screen with no way back.

Once your paper app is done, find another person in class to try your app.  You cannot provide any instruction as they use the app but will serve as the phone, laying down new paper screens as your user taps the paper buttons to navigate your app.  Take note of places where your app was unclear or where users got stuck.
