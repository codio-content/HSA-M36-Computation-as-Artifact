How can an idea become a reality?  To begin, lets select a medium to work within.  A current popular computational medium is the mobile app.  

The key to a good app is to find the "pain".  What is something about your life or the life of people that you know that could be made better by an app?  

<b>Your app ideas should:</b>
- Be socially and culturally relevant (solve a real problem)
- Focus on a need that exists in your community (this affects you or people you know)
- Not currently exist (idea should be original)

You will need to create an "elevator pitch" around your idea.  This is a quick (under 30 second) overview of your app and why it is needed.  The idea is that you have a short time with an influential person to pitch your idea.  You will share your idea with the class.
