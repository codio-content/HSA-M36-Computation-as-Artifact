Computers have changed the way we consume and distribute information.  Facts that previously had to be looked up in a library is easily accessible to anyone, anywhere.  Static materials like dictionaries and maps can now be a living, dynamic document with the ability to update in real-time and interactive to allow for searching, zooming, and other interactions that would not be possible with a printed document.

## Expression
The way we express ourselves has changed in response to computing.  Art can be created with digital tools and immediately distributed across the world.  Once expensive music production equipment has been replaced with applications that allow artists to record, mix, produce, and distribute their work without the barriers of money and access that has been in place during much of the history of recorded music.

Individuals can maintain blogs, photo pages, or other means of expressing their thoughts and experiences to a wide and authentic audience.  This type of expression would previously not have been possible without access to a printing press or similar technology.

## Communication
When the first telegraph was sent between New York and Chicago, the people observing did not believe that the signal was really traveling that distance in the given time.  The idea of high-speed communication was un-thinkable.  The advent of the telephone allowed people to talk all over the world but there was a high cost for "long distance" calls.  Today, the Internet and online tools allow for instant communication with people all over the world.  We can share text, images, voice, video and so much more in ways that were previously as difficult to imagine as that first telegraph.

## Collaboration
Through the Internet and online tools, people can work on the same document at the same time from remote locations.  Distributed methods of work allow people to work on aspects of a project, push their files to a centralized repository and then allow others to pull their files for testing.  

Computers have also allowed for collaboration on a massive scale.  Projects like Re Captcha are digitizing books by asking users to translate a word the computer cannot figure out.  Through the massive scale, they can digitize printed books at a rapid pace.
