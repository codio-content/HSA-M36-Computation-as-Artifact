Computing has enabled people to turn ideas into reality in ways previously unimaginable.  Ideas that would have had no outlet prior to computers now have a place to grow and be explored in new and innovative ways.

The idea of bringing ideas to life is not new, art, literature, music are all examples of something that started as an idea that became a real thing in the world.  Computing has enabled us to do that in the form of video games, software, data visualizations, and countless other creative artifacts of human thought.

Consider copyright law; an idea cannot be copyrighted.  The only thing that can be copyrighted is the form the idea takes.  For example, I cannot copyright a story idea I have but I can copyright a book or short story that I have written.  In fact, this is such a strong belief in our society that there are no extra steps to obtain copyright.  Once an idea takes physical form, the copyright is automatic.
